## The problem this solves

CodeSpec normally lives inside one code repo: an `codespec/` folder next to
your code, holding specs and changes for that repo.

That stops fitting the moment your planning is bigger than one repo:

- Your work spans several repos — one feature touches the API server, the
  web app, and a shared library. Whose `codespec/` folder does the plan
  live in?
- Your team plans before code exists, or plans things that never become
  code in *this* repo.
- Requirements are owned by one team and consumed by others. The wiki
  version drifts, and your coding agent can't read it anyway.

A **store** is the answer: a standalone repo whose whole job is planning.
It has the same `codespec/` shape you already know — specs and changes —
plus a small identity file. You register it on your machine once, by name,
and then every normal CodeSpec command can work in it from anywhere.

## The shape

```
            team-plans  (a store: planning in its own repo)
            ├── .codespec-store/store.yaml     identity: "I am team-plans"
            └── codespec/
                ├── specs/      what is true
                └── changes/    what is in motion
                      ▲
                      │ registered on each machine by name;
                      │ shared by pushing/cloning like any repo
        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
        │             │             │
    web-app       api-server     mobile-app
   (code repo)   (code repo)    (code repo)
```

Two rules keep this simple:

1. **A store is just a git repo.** You commit, push, pull, and review it
   yourself. CodeSpec never clones, syncs, or pushes anything on its own.
2. **Declarations, not machinery.** Repos can *declare* how they relate to
   stores (shown below). Declarations change what CodeSpec can tell you —
   never where your commands act.

## Five minutes to your first store

Two commands take you from nothing to a working, store-scoped change:

```bash
codespec store setup team-plans --path ~/codespec/team-plans
```

```
Store ready: team-plans
Location: /Users/you/codespec/team-plans
CodeSpec root: ready
Registry: registered

Next: run normal CodeSpec commands against this store, for example:
  codespec new change <change-id> --store team-plans
Share this store by committing and pushing it like any Git repo.
```

```bash
codespec new change add-login --store team-plans
```

```
Using CodeSpec root: team-plans (/Users/you/codespec/team-plans)
Created change 'add-login' at /Users/you/codespec/team-plans/codespec/changes/add-login/
Schema: spec-driven
Next: codespec status --change add-login --store team-plans
```

That's the whole model. From here the lifecycle is exactly what you know —
`status`, `instructions`, `validate`, `archive` — with `--store team-plans`
on each command, and every printed hint carries the flag for you. The
`Using CodeSpec root:` line always tells you where a command is acting.

## Story: one team, one planning repo

A team keeps its specs and changes in `team-plans` instead of scattering
them across code repos.

**Day one (whoever sets it up):**

```bash
codespec store setup team-plans --path ~/codespec/team-plans \
  --remote git@github.com:acme/team-plans.git
git -C ~/codespec/team-plans push -u origin main
```

Passing `--remote` records the clone URL inside the store's own identity
file (`.codespec-store/store.yaml`), in the initial commit. Every future
clone is born knowing where it came from, so health checks and error
messages can print a complete, pasteable fix for teammates who don't have
it yet.

**Every teammate (once per machine):**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:acme/team-plans.git ~/codespec/team-plans
codespec store register ~/codespec/team-plans
```

From then on, everyone works in the same planning repo by name:

```bash
codespec status --store team-plans --change add-login
codespec show add-login --store team-plans
```

**Sharing work is git, on purpose.** A change you create exists only in
your checkout until you commit and push it — same as code. Plans get
branches, pull requests, and review for free, because a store is an
ordinary repo.

**Connecting the team's code repos.** A code repo whose planning is fully
externalized needs exactly one line, in `codespec/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# web-app/codespec/config.yaml
store: team-plans
```

Now every CodeSpec command run inside `web-app` acts on `team-plans` with
no flags at all:

```bash
cd ~/src/web-app
codespec status --change add-login
```

```
Using CodeSpec root: team-plans (/Users/you/codespec/team-plans)
...
```

The pointer is a fallback, never an override: an explicit `--store` always
wins, and if the repo grows real planning folders of its own, those win
(with a warning to remove the stale pointer).

**One default for every repo on your machine.** If you work across many
code repos that all plan into the same store, set it once, globally,
instead of adding the `store:` line to each repo:

```bash
codespec config set defaultStore team-plans
```

Now any command run outside a planning root — and with no `--store` and no
project pointer — resolves to `team-plans`. It sits at the bottom of the
precedence list, so `--store`, a local root, and a project `store:` pointer
all still win. The root banner and JSON `root` block report
`source: "global_default"` with the store id, so you can always tell a
machine-wide default from a repo's own pointer. Clear it with
`codespec config unset defaultStore`. If the id is not registered, commands
error and tell you to register it or clear the stale default.

## Example: one feature, two component repos

Suppose `add-checkout-promo` changes both `checkout-api` and
`checkout-web`. The team wants one shared product contract, while each code
repo still needs its own implementation tasks, branch, and review.

Use two layers:

1. Keep the shared behavior in `team-plans`.
2. Keep implementation plans in each component repo and reference the store
   as read-only upstream context.

First, plan the shared contract in the store:

```bash
codespec new change add-checkout-promo --store team-plans
codespec status --change add-checkout-promo --store team-plans
```

The proposal and specs should describe the behavior at the boundary between
the components — for example, the promotion fields returned by the service
and how the frontend handles an ineligible checkout. Review this change in
the store repo like any other branch and pull request.

### What context does planning see?

Selecting a store changes the CodeSpec root; it does not discover or read
every code repo that uses that store. Store instructions see the artifacts
and configured context in the store. They see component code only when those
folders are also available to the agent or editor and the agent reads them.

A workset is a convenient way to open the planning store and both code repos
together:

```bash
codespec workset create checkout-promo \
  --member ~/codespec/team-plans \
  --member ~/src/checkout-api \
  --member ~/src/checkout-web \
  --tool code
codespec workset open checkout-promo
```

This makes the folders visible in one IDE workspace. It does not copy source
context into the store, select affected repos, or grant an agent permission
to edit them. Put durable cross-component facts in the shared specs; do not
rely on a planner remembering source it happened to inspect.

### How does implementation start in each repo?

When no explicit `--store` or nearer `codespec/` root applies, a
`store: team-plans` pointer routes commands to that store. It does not split
one store task list by the directory from which `apply` was invoked. CodeSpec
currently does not route tasks to repos.

When each component needs an independently scoped apply/review cycle, give it
a local CodeSpec root and reference the central store instead of pointing at
it:

```yaml
# checkout-api/codespec/config.yaml (and likewise in checkout-web)
schema: spec-driven
references:
  - team-plans
```

After the shared contract is approved and available in the store's main
specs, create a small local change for the component's part:

```bash
cd ~/src/checkout-api
codespec new change implement-checkout-promo-api

cd ~/src/checkout-web
codespec new change implement-checkout-promo-ui
```

The reference index in each repo's instructions supplies the store spec's
summary and exact `codespec show ... --store team-plans` fetch command. Each
local proposal cites that shared contract, and its tasks describe only work
in that component. Then run `/codespec:apply` in each repo separately; root
resolution keeps the artifacts and implementation edits scoped to that repo.
The service and frontend changes can now be tested, reviewed, merged, and
archived independently.

If implementation must begin while the shared store change is still active,
fetch it explicitly with
`codespec show add-checkout-promo --store team-plans`; reference indexes list
canonical store specs, not active store changes. Keep the store branch and
component branches linked in their pull-request descriptions so reviewers
can see which version of the contract each implementation follows.

## Story: requirements that cross team lines

A platform team owns the requirements. Product teams build against them,
in their own repos, with their own designs. A reference describes that
relationship without moving anyone's work.

```
   platform-reqs (store)                 api-server (code repo)
   owned by the platform team            owned by a product team
   ┌──────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ codespec/specs/          │ ◀────────│ codespec/config.yaml     │
   │   payments/spec.md       │ reads    │   references:            │
   │   auth/spec.md           │          │     - platform-reqs      │
   │                          │          │ codespec/specs/          │
   │ codespec/changes/        │          │   (their own designs)    │
   │   platform work          │          │ codespec/changes/        │
   │                          │          │   (their own work)       │
   │                          │          └──────────────────────────┘
   └──────────────────────────┘
```

**The product team declares what it draws on** in its repo's
`codespec/config.yaml`:

```yaml
references:
  - platform-reqs
```

References are read-only context. The repo keeps its own `codespec/` root;
work stays there. What changes: `codespec instructions` in that repo now
includes an index of the referenced store's specs — each with a one-line
summary and the exact fetch command (`codespec show <spec-id> --type spec
--store platform-reqs`). An agent working in `api-server` can find the
upstream payment requirements, cite them, and write its low-level design in
the repo's own root — without anyone pasting context around.

A reference can carry its clone source, so teammates who don't have the
store yet get a complete fix instead of a dead end:

```yaml
references:
  - { id: platform-reqs, remote: "git@github.com:acme/platform-reqs.git" }
```

**When you want the plan and code open together, make a workset.** This is
personal and explicit: each person chooses the folders they actually work
with on their machine. Nothing about those local checkout paths is
committed to the shared planning repo.

```bash
codespec workset create platform \
  --member ~/codespec/platform-reqs \
  --member ~/src/api-server \
  --member ~/src/web-app
```

## Two questions you can always ask

**"Is my setup healthy?"** — `codespec doctor` checks the current root and
its referenced stores, read-only, with a pasteable fix per finding:

```
Doctor

Root
  Location: /Users/you/src/api-server
  CodeSpec root: ok

References
  - platform-reqs: ok (/Users/you/codespec/platform-reqs)
  - design-system: Referenced store 'design-system' is not registered on this machine.
    Fix: git clone -- git@github.com:acme/design-system.git '/Users/you/codespec/design-system' && codespec store register '/Users/you/codespec/design-system' --id design-system

```

**"What am I working with?"** — `codespec context` assembles the working
set from CodeSpec declarations: the root and the stores it references.

```
Working context for api-server (/Users/you/src/api-server)

CodeSpec root
  api-server  /Users/you/src/api-server

Referenced stores
  platform-reqs  /Users/you/codespec/platform-reqs
    Fetch: codespec show <spec-id> --type spec --store platform-reqs
```

Both support `--json` for agents. `codespec context --code-workspace
<path>` additionally writes a VS Code workspace file containing the whole
set — the only write this command performs.

## Worksets: reopen the folders you work on together

Separate from all of the above: most people open the same few folders
together every session — the planning repo plus two or three code repos.
A **workset** is a personal, named view of exactly that, reopened with one
command in your tool of choice.

```
  workset "platform"                 codespec workset open platform
  ├── team-plans   ~/codespec/team-plans         │
  ├── api-server   ~/src/api-server              ▼
  └── web-app      ~/src/web-app       all three open in your tool
```

```bash
codespec workset create platform \
  --member ~/codespec/team-plans --member ~/src/api-server \
  --tool code
codespec workset list
```

```
platform  (opens in VS Code)
  team-plans  /Users/you/codespec/team-plans
  api-server  /Users/you/src/api-server
```

`codespec workset open platform` then launches the saved tool: editors
(VS Code, Cursor) open one window with every member and return. The first
member is the primary. Override the tool any time with `--tool <id>`.

Worksets are deliberately *not* shared state. They live on your machine,
are never committed, and make no claims about the work — they only record
what you like open together. Removing one never touches the member
folders. New tools are configuration, not code: anything launched via a
workspace file or per-folder attach flags can be added under the `openers`
key in the global config (`codespec config edit`).

## How commands decide where to act

Every normal command resolves its root the same way, in this order:

```
1. --store <id>          you said so explicitly        → that store
2. nearest codespec/     a real planning root here     → this repo
   (walking up from cwd)
3. store: pointer        config.yaml declares a store  → that store
4. defaultStore          global config sets a machine  → that store
                         default
5. none of the above     stores registered on this     → error with a
                         machine?                        selection hint
                         no stores registered?         → the current
                                                          directory
                                                          (classic behavior)
```

The `Using CodeSpec root:` line (and the `root` block in `--json` output)
tells you which case you're in.

## Known limitations

- **Beta shape.** Everything on this page may change between releases —
  names, flags, file formats, JSON keys.
- **One checkout per store id per machine.** Registering a second checkout
  under the same id fails with a hint to `store unregister` first.
- **No sync, ever — by design.** CodeSpec never clones, pulls, or pushes.
  A stale checkout shows stale specs until *you* pull; references are
  indexed live from whatever is on disk.
- **Empty planning folders can be absent.** A new store may not have
  `codespec/changes/`, `codespec/specs/`, or `codespec/changes/archive/` in Git
  yet. That is accepted during the beta; those folders appear once normal
  commands create files for them.
- **Pointer repos stay pointers.** A config-only repo whose
  `codespec/config.yaml` declares `store: <id>` is treated as externalized
  planning, not as a store checkout to register. Remove the `store:` line first
  if you intentionally want to convert that repo into a local store root.
- **Some commands stay where they are.** `templates` and the
  deprecated noun forms (`codespec change show`, ...) act on the current
  directory only — no `--store`. `schemas` follows the canonical root-selection
  precedence and accepts `--store <id>` while keeping its successful JSON array
  shape unchanged.
- **Per-machine state is per-machine.** The store registry and worksets
  are local settings. Nothing about your machine's layout is
  ever committed to shared planning.
- **Two launch styles for worksets.** A tool that can't be launched with a
  workspace file or per-folder attach flags can't be added as an opener.
- **Agent JSON has a known casing split** (store-family keys are
  snake_case, workflow-family camelCase). Documented in the
  [agent contract](../agent-contract.md); unifying it is deferred to a
  versioned release.

## Where things live

| What | Where | Shared? |
|---|---|---|
| A store's planning | `<store>/codespec/` (specs, changes) | Yes — commit and push it |
| A store's identity | `<store>/.codespec-store/store.yaml` | Yes — committed with the store |
| The store registry | `<data dir>/codespec/stores/registry.yaml` | No — this machine only |
| Worksets | `<data dir>/codespec/worksets/` | No — this machine only |

`<data dir>` is `~/.local/share/codespec` on macOS and Linux (or
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/codespec` when set), and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codespec` on
Windows.
